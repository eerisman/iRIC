Idealized Retention Index Calcaulation

Version 0.007
Date: December 7, 2022

Contact: edward.erisman@nist.gov

System requirements: Windows operating system

Usage:

To use the iRIC simply double click "iRIC.bat". A command window will temporarily appear, followed by a window (or tab) of your systems default internet browser (network connection not necessary). After less than 20 seconds, the iRIC should be fully loaded and ready for use. To close the iRIC, simply exit out of your browser and all underlying processes will automatically end.

Notes:
This is a rough model of idealized retention behavior.  The order of the alkanes or compound 1 or 2 does should not matter (eg alkane 1/compound 1 could be greater or less than alkane 2/compound 2).  Compound 2 is assumed to have the same width as compound 1.  Peak shapes are assumed to be gaussian and the resolution is calcaulted by R= 1.18(t2-t1)/(w1+w2).
